# dirmapper
development of prototype classes and methods

the purpose of dirmapper is to read a codebase
and present an easily decipherable map of 
how files relate to each other and any
external libraries

the backend should contain relatively simple logic

the frontend should be created using a markup language
latex is easy but probably not practical as a dependancy

lets try XML?
